- For an automobile to be autonomous, it needs to be continuously aware of its surroundings—first, by perceiving (identifying and classifying information) and then acting on the information through the autonomous/computer control of the vehicle.
- Autonomous vehicles require safe, secure, and highly responsive solutions that need to be able to make split-second decisions based on a detailed understanding of the driving environment. Understanding the driving environment requires an enormous amount of data to be captured by myriad different sensors across the car, which is then processed by the vehicle’s autonomous driving computer system.
