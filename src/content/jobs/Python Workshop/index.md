- The low-level control system of the vehicle is based on closed-loop feedback control â€“ PID controller. We use two PID loops, one for each wheel. The target velocity for the vehicle is generated by the higher-level software and is disintegrated into wheel velocities and fed in the controller.
- The feedback is received from the highly 14 Figure 18: Low-level Control System precise wheel encoders, which not only provide feedback to the controller but also publishes the raw data for odometry updates.
