- We develop a self-driving vehicle whose primary objective is to mitigate road fatalities - which are generally caused by human negligence.
- Though driverless vehicles go a long way in reducing day-to-day accidents, the robust systems that we develop may still have some loopholes and vulnerabilities. As a result, this allows malicious hackers to take advantage of such inadequacies. Any autonomous vehicleâ€™s cyber-risk is of prime concern to insurers, regulators and policing authorities, thus, an appropriate method for risk assessment is required.
