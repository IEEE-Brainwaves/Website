- IEEE organized a seminar for the students of our college to enlighten them about the food scarcity problems and global warming. The speaker for the session was Shri. Bhadsavle Sir who is an agri-entrepreneur and a rich writer under the domain of agriculture. He addressed the alarming need for reducing the carbon content in the atmosphere which is affecting the soil health drastically. He placed his points forward by utilizing some videos and presentations for better understanding. He introduced the rice cultivation technique that he practices which leads to no methane production which in turn lessens global warming. A QnA session helped the students to know more about his approach and also about the advancements they can make. Followed by it, Mr. Anil demonstrated a technique named SVT which was proved to be cost-effective and an increase in the cultivation rate.
