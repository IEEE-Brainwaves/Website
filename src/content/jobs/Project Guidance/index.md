- The IEEE Mentorship Program is designed to connect 3rd year students with DJSCOE alumni, and they in turn pass on the knowledge to the 2nd year students. Allowing them the opportunity to gain valuable experience and advice for career development. The relationship between mentors and mentees is viewed as a partnership and the length of each Mentor match is approximately 6 months. The Mentorship Program is not intended as a job placement service for students, but is offered as a tool for students seeking career path advice from successful and experienced DJSCOE alumni.
