- Jay Mehta who is presently working at Motilal Oswal Private Equity with an MBA from Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies had joined us as an expert on the topic of Equity Markets. He has also been a part of the JP Morgan and Edelweiss team for 3 years and is also an Alumni of DJSCE. There was a successfull discussion on how to identify high growth low valuation companies in Equity Markets. The session was equally important for all years giving the first and second-year students an insight into the equity markets and providing an added advantage to the third and fourth-year students for placements in companies in the financial sector. Based on the knowledge acquired by the students in the session, it could easily be called a masterclass on Equity Markets.
